This projectpresents an automated solution using deep learning-basedsemantic segmentation to identify and isolate tumor re-gions in brain MRI scans. We implemented and com-pared four popular architectures: U-Net, Attention U-Net, Fully Convolutional Networks (FCN), and SegNet.A custom dataset was manually split and preprocessed,and each model was trained for 30 epochs using a combi-nation of Dice loss and Binary Cross-Entropy loss. Theevaluation was done using Dice Score, Intersection overUnion (IoU), and Pixel Accuracy.
